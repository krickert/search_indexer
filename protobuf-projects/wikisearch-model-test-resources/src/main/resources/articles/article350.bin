41642Reflection lossŒIn telecommunications, reflection loss occurs on a line which results in part of the energy being reflected back to the source. This can occur:
#At a discontinuity or impedance mismatch, e.g., in a transmission line, the ratio of the incident power to the reflected power. Reflection loss is usually expressed in dB. 
#In an optical fiber, the loss that takes place at any discontinuity of refractive index, especially at an air-glass interface such as a fiber endface, at which a fraction of the optical signal is reflected back toward the source. This reflection phenomenon is also called "Fresnel reflection loss," or simply "Fresnel loss."

In [[telecommunications]], '''reflection loss''' occurs on a line which results in part of the energy being reflected back to the source. This can occur:
#At a discontinuity or [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] mismatch, e.g., in a [[transmission line]], the ratio of the incident [[Power (physics)|power]] to the reflected power. Reflection loss is usually expressed in [[decibel|dB]]. 
#In an [[optical fiber]], the loss that takes place at any discontinuity of [[refractive index]], especially at an air-[[glass]] [[wiktionary:interface|interface]] such as a fiber endface, at which a fraction of the optical [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] is reflected back toward the source. This reflection phenomenon is also called "'''[[Fresnel reflection]] loss'''," or simply "'''Fresnel loss'''."
