41650 Release time (telecommunication)≥In telecommunication, release time is the time interval for a circuit to respond when an enabling signal is discontinued, for example:
#in an automatic gain control or echo suppressor circuit, the time interval between the end of the enabling signal and the instant at which suppression ceases,
#for a relay, the time between when the coil is de-energized, and the instant that contact closure ceases or is established.
