Systems of ever-increasing complexity and capability can be built by adding or changing the layers to improve overall system capability while using the components that are still in place."îIn [[telecommunication]], a '''layered system''' is a [[system]] in which components are grouped, ''i.e.'', layered, in a hierarchical arrangement, such that lower layers provide functions and services that support the functions and services of higher layers.
