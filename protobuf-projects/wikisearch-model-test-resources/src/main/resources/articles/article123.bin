41376Mode volumeóIn fiber optics, mode volume is the number of bound modes that an optical fiber is capable of supporting.  

The mode volume M is approximately given by V^2 \over 2 and {V^2 \over 2} \left({g \over g+2}\right), respectively for step-index and power-law index profile fibers, where g is the profile parameter, and V is the normalized frequency, which must be greater than 5 for this approximation to be valid.

In [[fiber optics]], '''mode volume''' is the number of bound [[Transverse mode|modes]] that an [[optical fiber]] is capable of supporting.  

The mode volume ''M'' is approximately given by <math>V^2 \over 2</math> and <math>{V^2 \over 2} \left({g \over g+2}\right)</math>, respectively for [[step-index profile|step-index]] and [[power-law index profile]] fibers, where ''g'' is the profile parameter, and ''V'' is the [[normalized frequency (fiber optics)|normalized frequency]], ''which must be greater than 5 for this approximation to be valid''.
