41321Link quality analysis‚In adaptive high-frequency (HF) radio, link quality analysis (LQA) is the overall process by which measurements of signal quality are made, assessed, and analyzed.

In LQA, signal quality is determined by measuring, assessing, and analyzing link parameters, such as bit error ratio (BER), and the levels of the ratio of signal-plus-noise-plus-distortion to noise-plus-distortion (SINAD). Measurements are stored atâ€”and exchanged betweenâ€”stations, for use in making decisions about link establishment.

For adaptive HF radio, LQA is automatically performed and is usually based on analyses of pseudo-BERs and SINAD readings.

In adaptive [[high-frequency]] (HF) [[radio]], '''link quality analysis''' ('''LQA''') is the overall process by which measurements of [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] quality are made, assessed, and analyzed.

In LQA, signal quality is determined by measuring, assessing, and analyzing [[Data link|link]] parameters, such as [[bit error ratio]] (BER), and the levels of the ratio of signal-plus-[[noise]]-plus-[[distortion]] to noise-plus-distortion ([[SINAD]]). Measurements are stored atâ€”and exchanged betweenâ€”stations, for use in making decisions about link establishment.

For adaptive HF radio, LQA is automatically performed and is usually based on analyses of pseudo-BERs and SINAD readings.
