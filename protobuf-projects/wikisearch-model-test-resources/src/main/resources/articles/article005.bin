41248Hydroxyl ion absorptionÒHydroxyl ion absorption is the absorption in optical fibers of electromagnetic waves, including the near-infrared, due to the presence of trapped hydroxyl ions remaining from water as a contaminant. 

The hydroxyl (OHâˆ’) ion, can penetrate glass during or after product fabrication, resulting in significant attenuation of discrete optical wavelengths, e.g., centred at 1.383 Î¼m, used for communications via optical fibres.
