Quadrature£Quadrature may refer to:

In signal processing:
*Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), a modulation method of using both an (in-phase) carrier wave and a 'quadrature' carrier wave that is 90Â° out of phase with the main, or in-phase, carrier
*Quadrature phase, oscillations that are said to be in quadrature if they are separated in phase by 90Â° (/2, or /4)
*Quadrature filter, the analytic signal of a real-valued filter
*Quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), a phase-shift keying of using four quadrate points on the constellation diagram, equispaced around a circle

In mathematics:
* Quadrature (mathematics), drawing a square with the same area as a given plane figure (squaring) or computing that area
** Quadrature of the circle
* Numerical integration is often called 'numerical quadrature' or simply 'quadrature'
** Gaussian quadrature, a special case of numerical integration
* Formerly, a synonym for "integral"
** Integral
** Antiderivative
* Addition in quadrature, combining the magnitude of uncorrelated signals by taking the square root of the sum of their squares

In physics:
* In Optical phase space, quadratures are operators which represent the real and imaginary parts of the complex amplitude; see also in-phase and quadrature components

In astronomy:
* Quadrature (astronomy), the position of a body (moon or planet) such that its elongation is 90Â° or 270Â°; i.e. the body-earth-sun angle is 90Â°

In Hedge-funds:
*Quadrature (hedge-fund), the quant hedge-fund created in 2010, in London,England. 

Quadrature may also refer to:
* Quadrature encoder, a device that detects mechanical position changes and direction of movement
* Illusionistic ceiling painting, sometimes called quadrature after the Italian term, quadratura
* La Quadrature du Net (Squaring of the Net in French), a French advocacy group that promotes digital rights and freedoms of citizens
* "Quadrature", a song by Squarepusher from the album Just a Souvenir"{{wiktionary|quadrature}}
