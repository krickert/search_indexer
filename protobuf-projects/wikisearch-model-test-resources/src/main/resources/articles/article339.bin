41629Received noise poweržIn telecommunications, received noise power is a measure of noise in a receiver. For example, the received noise power might be:
#The calculated or measured noise power, within the bandwidth being used, at the receive end of a circuit, channel, link, or system.
#The absolute power of the noise measured or calculated at a receive point. The related bandwidth and the noise weighting must also be specified.
#The value of noise power, from all sources, measured at the line terminals of a telephone set's receiver.' Either flat weighting or some other specific amplitude-frequency characteristic or noise weighting characteristic must be associated with the measurement."‚{{no footnotes|date=January 2013}}
In [[telecommunication]]s, '''received noise power''' is a measure of [[noise]] in a receiver. For example, the received noise power might be:
#The calculated or measured [[noise power]], within the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] being used, at the receive end of a [[Telecommunication circuit|circuit]], [[Communication channel|channel]], [[Data link|link]], or [[Communications system|system]].
#The absolute [[Power (physics)|power]] of the noise measured or calculated at a receive point. The related bandwidth and the [[noise weighting]] must also be specified.
#The value of noise power, from all sources, measured at the [[telephone line|line]] terminals of a [[telephone]] set's receiver.' Either [[flat weighting]] or some other specific [[amplitude]]-[[frequency]] characteristic or [[noise weighting]] characteristic must be associated with the measurement.
