Long-term frequency changes are caused by changes in the oscillator elements that determine frequency, such as crystal drift, inductance changes, and capacitance changes."¡In [[electronics]], the '''long-term stability''' of an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]] is the degree of uniformity of [[frequency]] over [[time]], when the frequency is measured under identical environmental conditions, such as supply [[voltage]], [[Electrical load|load]], and [[temperature]]. Long-term frequency changes are caused by changes in the oscillator elements that determine frequency, such as crystal [[drift (telecommunication)|drift]], [[inductance]] changes, and [[capacitance]] changes.
