41388Multiplex basebandÈIn telecommunication, the term multiplex baseband has the following meanings: 
#In frequency-division multiplexing, the frequency band occupied by the aggregate of the signals in the line interconnecting the multiplexing and radio or line equipment.  
#In frequency division multiplexed carrier systems, at the input to any stage of frequency translation, the frequency band occupied. 

For example, the output of a group multiplexer consists of a band of frequencies from 60Â kHz to 108Â kHz. This is the group-level baseband that results from combining 12 voice-frequency input channels, having a bandwidth of 4Â kHz each, including guard bands. In turn, 5 groups are multiplexed into a super group having a baseband of 312Â kHz to 552Â kHz. This baseband, however, does not represent a group-level baseband. Ten super groups are in turn multiplexed into one master group, the output of which is a baseband that may be used to modulate a microwave-frequency carrier."Ê	In [[telecommunication]], the term '''multiplex baseband''' has the following meanings: 
#In [[frequency-division multiplexing]], the frequency [[band (radio)|band]] occupied by the aggregate of the signals in the [[line (electrical engineering)|line]] interconnecting the multiplexing and [[radio]] or line equipment.  
#In frequency division multiplexed [[carrier signal|carrier]] systems, at the input to any stage of [[frequency translation]], the frequency band occupied. 

For example, the output of a group [[multiplexer]] consists of a band of frequencies from 60&nbsp;kHz to 108&nbsp;kHz. This is the group-level [[baseband]] that results from combining 12 [[voice-frequency]] input channels, having a [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of 4&nbsp;kHz each, including guard bands. In turn, 5 groups are multiplexed into a super group having a baseband of 312&nbsp;kHz to 552&nbsp;kHz. This baseband, however, does not represent a group-level baseband. Ten super groups are in turn multiplexed into one master group, the output of which is a baseband that may be used to modulate a [[microwave]]-frequency carrier.
