In [[telecommunication]], a '''medium-power talker''' is a hypothetical talker, within a [[log-normal distribution]] of talkers, whose volume lies at the [[Average|medium]] [[Power (physics)|power]] of all talkers determining the volume distribution at the point of interest.  

When the distribution follows a log-normal curve (values expressed in decibels), the mean and standard deviation can be used to compute the medium-power talker. The talker volume distribution follows a log-normal curve and the medium-power talker is uniquely determined by the average talker volume. The medium-power talker volume, ''V'', is given by ''V'' = ''V'' <sub>o</sub> + 0.115œÉ<sup>2</sup>, where ''V'' <sub>o</sub> is the average of the talker volume distribution in volume units (vu), and œÉ<sup>2</sup> is the [[variance]] of the distribution.
