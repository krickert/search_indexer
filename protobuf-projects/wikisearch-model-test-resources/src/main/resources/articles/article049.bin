41293Isochronous signalœIn telecommunication, an isochronous signal is a signal in which the time interval separating any two significant instants is equal to the unit interval or a multiple of the unit interval. Variations in the time intervals are constrained within specified limits.

"Isochronous" is a characteristic of one signal, while "synchronous" indicates a relationship between two or more signals.

In [[telecommunication]], an '''isochronous signal''' is a [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] in which the [[time]] interval separating any two significant instants is equal to the [[Unit interval (data transmission)|unit interval]] or a multiple of the unit interval. Variations in the time intervals are constrained within specified limits.

"[[Isochronous]]" is a characteristic of one signal, while "[[Synchronization|synchronous]]" indicates a relationship between two or more signals.
