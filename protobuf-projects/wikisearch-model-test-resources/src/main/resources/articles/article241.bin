41510Phase distortionæIn signal processing, phase distortion or phase-frequency distortion is distortion, that is, change in the shape of the waveform,  that occurs when (a) a filter's phase response is not linear over the frequency range of interest, that is, the phase shift introduced by a circuit or device is not directly proportional to frequency, or (b) the zero-frequency intercept of the phase-frequency characteristic is not 0 or an integral multiple of 2Ï€ radians.

Audibility of phase distortion

Grossly changed phase relationships, without changing amplitudes, can be audible but the degree of audibility of the type of phase shifts expected from typical sound systems remains debated.

In [[signal processing]], '''phase distortion''' or '''phase-frequency distortion''' is [[distortion]], that is, change in the shape of the waveform,  that occurs when (a) a filter's [[phase response]] is not linear over the [[frequency range]] of interest, that is, the [[Phase (waves)|phase shift]] introduced by a [[electrical network|circuit]] or device is not directly proportional to frequency, or (b) the zero-frequency intercept of the phase-frequency characteristic is not 0 or an integral multiple of 2Ï€ radians.
