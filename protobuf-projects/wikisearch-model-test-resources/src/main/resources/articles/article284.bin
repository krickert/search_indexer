 n(r) = 
  \begin{cases}
    n_1 \sqrt{1-2\Delta\left({r \over \alpha}\right)^g} & r \le \alpha\\
    n_1 \sqrt{1-2\Delta} & r \ge \alpha
  \end{cases}
where
\Delta = {n_1^2 - n_2^2 \over 2 n_1^2},

and  n(r) is the nominal refractive index as a function of distance from the fiber axis, n_1 is the nominal refractive index on axis, n_2 is the refractive index of the cladding, which is taken to be homogeneous (n(r)=n_2 \mathrm{\ for\ } r \ge \alpha), \alpha is the core radius, and g is a parameter that defines the shape of the profile. \alpha is often used in place of g. Hence, this is sometimes called an alpha profile. 

For this class of profiles, multimode distortion is smallest when g takes a particular value depending on the material used. For most materials, this optimum value is approximately 2. In the limit of infinite g, the profile becomes a step-index profile.

For [[optical fiber]]s, a '''power-law index profile''' is an [[index of refraction]] profile characterized by 

:<math> n(r) = 
  \begin{cases}
    n_1 \sqrt{1-2\Delta\left({r \over \alpha}\right)^g} & r \le \alpha\\
    n_1 \sqrt{1-2\Delta} & r \ge \alpha
  \end{cases}</math>
where
<math>\Delta = {n_1^2 - n_2^2 \over 2 n_1^2},</math>

and <math> n(r)</math> is the nominal refractive index as a function of distance from the [[fiber axis]], <math>n_1</math> is the nominal refractive index on axis, <math>n_2</math> is the refractive index of the [[Cladding (fiber optics)|cladding]], which is taken to be homogeneous (<math>n(r)=n_2 \mathrm{\ for\ } r \ge \alpha</math>), <math>\alpha</math> is the [[Fiber_optics#Principle_of_operation|core]] radius, and <math>g</math> is a parameter that defines the shape of the profile. <math>\alpha</math> is often used in place of <math>g</math>. Hence, this is sometimes called an '''alpha profile'''. 

For this class of profiles, [[multimode distortion]] is smallest when <math>g</math> takes a particular value depending on the material used. For most materials, this optimum value is approximately 2. In the [[Limit of a function|limit]] of infinite <math>g</math>, the profile becomes a [[step-index profile]].
