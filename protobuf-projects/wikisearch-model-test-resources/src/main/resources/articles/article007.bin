IdentifierÇ7An identifier is a name that identifies (that is, labels the identity of) either a unique object or a unique class of objects, where the "object" or class may be an idea, physical countable object (or class thereof), or physical noncountable substance (or class thereof). The abbreviation ID often refers to identity, identification (the process of identifying), or an identifier (that is, an instance of identification). An identifier may be a word, number, letter, symbol, or any combination of those.

The words, numbers, letters, or symbols may follow an encoding system (wherein letters, digits, words, or symbols stand for [represent] ideas or longer names) or they may simply be arbitrary. When an identifier follows an encoding system, it is often referred to as a code or IDÂ code.  For instance the ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry standard defines a code as system of valid symbols that substitute for longer values in contrast to identifiers without symbolic meaning. Identifiers that do not follow any encoding scheme are often said to be arbitraryÂ IDs; they are arbitrarily assigned and have no greater meaning. (Sometimes identifiers are called "codes" even when they are actually arbitrary, whether because the speaker believes that they have deeper meaning or simply because they are speaking casually and imprecisely.)

The unique identifier (UID) is an identifier that refers to only one instanceâ€”only one particular object in the universe. A part number is an identifier, but it is not a unique identifierâ€”for that, a serial number is needed, to identify each instance of the part design. Thus the identifier "ModelÂ T" identifies the class (model) of automobiles that Ford's ModelÂ T comprises; whereas the unique identifier "ModelÂ TÂ Serial NumberÂ 159,862" identifies one specific member of that classâ€”that is, one particular ModelÂ T car, owned by one specific person.

The concepts of name and identifier are denotatively equal, and the terms are thus denotatively synonymous; but they are not always connotatively synonymous, because code names and ID numbers are often connotatively distinguished from names in the sense of traditional natural language naming. For example, both "Jamie Zawinski" and "Netscape employee number 20" are identifiers for the same specific human being; but normal English-language connotation may consider "Jamie Zawinski" a "name" and not an "identifier", whereas it considers "NetscapeÂ employeeÂ numberÂ 20" an "identifier" but not a "name." This is an emic indistinction rather than an etic one.

Metadata

In metadata, an identifier is a language-independent label, sign or token that uniquely identifies an object within an identification scheme. The suffix "identifier" is also used as a representation term when naming a data element.

ID codes may inherently carry metadata along with them. For example, when you know that the food package in front of you has the identifier "2011-09-25T15:42Z-MFR5-P02-243-45", you not only have that data, you also have the metadata that tells you that it was packaged on September 25, 2011, at 3:42pm UTC, manufactured by Licensed Vendor Number 5, at the Peoria, IL, USA plant, in Building 2, and was the 243rd package off the line in that shift, and was inspected by Inspector Number 45.

Arbitrary identifiers might lack metadata. For example, if a food package just says 100054678214, its ID may not tell anything except identityâ€”no date, manufacturer name, production sequence rank, or inspector number. In some cases, arbitrary identifiers such as sequential serial numbers leak information (i.e. the German tank problem). Opaque identifiersâ€”identifiers designed to avoid leaking even that small amount of informationâ€”include "really opaque pointers" and Version 4 UUIDs.

In computer science 

In computer science, identifiers (IDs) are lexical tokens that name entities. Identifiers are used extensively in virtually all information processing systems. Identifying entities makes it possible to refer to them, which is essential for any kind of symbolic processing.

In computer languages 

In computer languages, identifiers are tokens (also called symbols) which name language entities. Some of the kinds of entities an identifier might denote include variables, types, labels, subroutines,  and packages.

Ambiguity 

Identifiers (IDs) versus Unique identifiers (UIDs)

A resource may carry multiple identifiers. Typical examples are:
* One person with multiple names, nicknames, and forms of address (titles, salutations)
** For example: One specific person may be identified by all of the following identifiers: JaneÂ Smith; JaneÂ ElizabethÂ MeredithÂ Smith; JaneÂ E.Â M.Â Smith; JaneÂ E.Â Smith; JanieÂ Smith; Janie; LittleÂ Janie (as opposed to her mother or sister or cousin, BigÂ Janie); AuntÂ Jane; AuntieÂ Janie; Mom; Grandmom; Nana; Kelly'sÂ mother; Billy'sÂ grandmother; Ms.Â Smith; Dr.Â Smith; JaneÂ E.Â Smith,Â PhD; and Fuzzy (her jocular nickname at work).
* One document with multiple versions
* One substance with multiple names (for example, CAS index names versus IUPAC names; INN generic drug names versus USAN generic drug names versus brand names)

The inverse is also possible, where multiple resources are represented with the same identifier (discussed below).

Implicit context and namespace conflicts

Many codes and nomenclatural systems originate within a small namespace. Over the years, some of them bleed into larger namespaces (as people interact in ways they formerly hadn't, e.g., cross-border trade, scientific collaboration, military alliance, and general cultural interconnection or assimilation). When such dissemination happens, the limitations of the original naming convention, which had formerly been latent and moot, become painfully apparent, often necessitating retronymy, synonymity,
translation/transcoding, and so on. Such limitations generally accompany the shift away from the original context to the broader one. Typically the system shows implicit context (context was formerly assumed, and narrow), lack of capacity (e.g., low number  of possible IDs, reflecting the outmoded narrow context), lack of extensibility (no features defined and reserved against future needs), and lack of specificity and disambiguating capability (related to the context shift, where longstanding uniqueness encounters novel nonuniqueness). Within computer science, this problem is called naming collision. The story of the origination and expansion of the CODEN system provides a good case example in a recent-decades, technical-nomenclature context. The capitalization variations seen with specific designators reveals an instance of this problem occurring in natural languages, where the properÂ noun/commonÂ noun distinction (and its complications) must be dealt with. A universe in which every object had a UID would not need any namespaces, which is to say that it would constitute one gigantic namespace; but human minds could never keep track of, or semantically interrelate, so many UIDs.

An '''identifier''' is a name that identifies (that is, labels the identity of) either a unique object or a unique ''class'' of objects, where the "object" or class may be an idea, physical [[countable]] object (or class thereof), or physical [[mass noun|noncountable]] substance (or class thereof). The abbreviation '''ID''' often refers to identity, identification (the process of identifying), or an identifier (that is, an instance of identification). An identifier may be a word, number, letter, symbol, or any combination of those.

The words, numbers, letters, or symbols may follow an [[code|encoding system]] (wherein letters, digits, words, or symbols ''stand for'' [represent] ideas or longer names) or they may simply be arbitrary. When an identifier follows an encoding system, it is often referred to as a '''code''' or '''ID&nbsp;code'''.  For instance the [[ISO/IEC 11179]] metadata registry standard defines a code as ''system of valid symbols that substitute for longer values'' in contrast to identifiers without symbolic meaning. Identifiers that do not follow any encoding scheme are often said to be '''arbitrary&nbsp;IDs'''; they are arbitrarily assigned and have no greater meaning. (Sometimes identifiers are called "codes" even when they are actually arbitrary, whether because the speaker believes that they have deeper meaning or simply because they are speaking casually and imprecisely.)

The [[unique identifier]] ('''UID''') is an identifier that refers to ''only one instance''â€”only one particular object in the universe. A [[part number]] is an identifier, but it is not a ''unique'' identifierâ€”for that, a [[serial number]] is needed, to identify ''each instance'' of the part design. Thus the ''identifier'' "Model&nbsp;T" identifies the ''class'' ''(model)'' of automobiles that Ford's [[Ford Model T|Model&nbsp;T]] comprises; whereas the ''unique identifier'' "Model&nbsp;T&nbsp;Serial Number&nbsp;159,862" identifies one specific member of that classâ€”that is, one particular Model&nbsp;T car, owned by one specific person.

The concepts of ''name'' and ''identifier'' are [[denotation|denotatively]] equal, and the terms are thus denotatively [[synonym]]ous; but they are not always [[connotation|connotatively]] synonymous, because '''[[code name]]s''' and '''ID numbers''' are often connotatively distinguished from names in the sense of traditional [[natural language]] naming. For example, both "[[Jamie Zawinski]]" and "[[Netscape]] employee number 20" are identifiers for the same specific human being; but normal English-language connotation may consider "Jamie Zawinski" a "name" and not an "identifier", whereas it considers "Netscape&nbsp;employee&nbsp;number&nbsp;20" an "identifier" but not a "name." This is an [[emic]] indistinction rather than an [[etic]] one.

A universe in which every object had a UID would not need any namespaces, which is to say that it would constitute one gigantic namespace; but human minds could never keep track of, or semantically interrelate, so many UIDs.
