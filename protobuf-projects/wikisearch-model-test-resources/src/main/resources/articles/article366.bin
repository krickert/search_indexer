41658ReradiationãIn telecommunication, the term reradiation has the following meanings:

#Electromagnetic radiation, at the same or different wavelengths, i.e., frequencies, of energy received from an incident wave.
#Undesirable radiation of signals locally generated in a radio receiver.  This type of radiation might cause interference or reveal the location of the device.

Near-field effects of an AM antenna may extend out two miles (3¬†km) or more. Cellular and microwave towers within this radius can reflect the Medium Wave AM signal out at a phase which cancels the main Medium Wave AM signal.  This process results in an interfering signal called reradiation.[http://www.lbagroup.com/associates/lbatn102.php Detuning Communications Towers Solves Reradiation Problem: Technical Note 102]"ûIn [[telecommunication]], the term '''reradiation''' has the following meanings:
