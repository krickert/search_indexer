41383Multicast addressÊ3A multicast address is a logical identifier for a group of hosts in a computer network that are available to process datagrams or frames intended to be multicast for a designated network service. Multicast addressing can be used in the link layer (layer 2 in the OSI model), such as Ethernet multicast, and at the internet layer (layer 3 for OSI) for Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) or Version 6 (IPv6) multicast.

IPv4

IPv4 multicast addresses are defined by the most-significant bit pattern of 1110. This originates from the classful network design of the early Internet when this group of addresses was designated as Class D. The CIDR notation for this group is .[https://www.ge.com/digital/documentation/cimplicity/version10/oxy_ex-2/advanced_features/topics/g_cimplicity_advanced_features_multicast_ip_addr.html MULTICAST_IP_ADDR]. General Electric Digital Solutions. CIMPLICITY 10.0. In network prefix or Classless Inter-Domain Routing ( CIDR) notation, IP multicast addresses are summarized as 224.0.0.0/4. The group includes the addresses from  to . Address assignments from within this range are specified in RFC 5771, an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Best Current Practice document (BCP 51).

The address range is divided into blocks each assigned a specific purpose or behavior.

;Local subnetwork
Addresses in the range of  to  are individually assigned by IANA and designated for multicasting on the local subnetwork only. For example, the Routing Information Protocol (RIPv2) uses , Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) uses  and , and Multicast DNS uses . Routers must not forward these messages outside the subnet from which they originate.

;Internetwork control block
Addresses in the range  to  are individually assigned by IANA and designated as the internetwork control block. This block of addresses is used for traffic that must be routed through the public Internet, such as for applications of the Network Time Protocol using .

;AD-HOC block 
Addresses in three separate blocks are not individually assigned by IANA. These addresses are globally routed and are used for applications that don't fit either of the previously described purposes.RFC 5771 Section 6.

;Source-specific multicast
The  (IPv4) and  (IPv6) blocks are reserved for use by source-specific multicast.

;GLOP
The  range was originally assigned by  as an experimental, public statically-assigned multicast address space for publishers and Internet service providers that wished to source content on the Internet. The allocation method is termed GLOP addressing and provides implementers a block of 255 addresses that is determined by their 16-bit autonomous system number (ASN) allocation. In a nutshell, the middle two octets of this block are formed from assigned ASNs, giving any operator assigned an ASN 256 globally unique multicast group addresses. The method is not applicable to the newer 32-bit ASNs. , superseding , envisioned the use of the range for many-to-many multicast applications. Unfortunately, with only 256 multicast addresses available to each autonomous system, GLOP is not adequate for large-scale broadcasters.

;Unicast-prefix-based
The  range is assigned by  as a range of global IPv4 multicast address space provided to each organization that has  or larger globally routed unicast address space allocated; one multicast address is reserved per  of unicast space. A resulting advantage over GLOP is that the unicast-prefix mechanism resembles the unicast-prefix capabilities of IPv6 as defined in .

;Administratively scoped
The  range is assigned by RFC 2365 for private use within an organization.  Per the RFC, packets destined to administratively scoped IPv4 multicast addresses do not cross administratively defined organizational boundaries, and administratively scoped IPv4 multicast addresses are locally assigned and do not have to be globally unique.  The RFC also discusses structuring the  range to be loosely similar to the scoped IPv6 multicast address range described in .

Notable IPv4 multicast addresses

The following table is a list of notable well-known IPv4 addresses that are reserved for IP multicasting and that are registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).

IPv6

Multicast addresses in IPv6 use the prefix . IPv6 multicast addresses can be structured using the old format (RFC 2373) or the new format (RFC 3306, updated by RFC 7371).

The prefix holds the value  for all multicast addresses.

Currently, 3 of the 4 flag bits in the flags field (ff1) are defined; the most-significant flag bit is reserved for future use. The other three flags are known as R, P and T. All 4 bits in the additional flags field (ff2) are reserved for future use and must hold the value 0.

Similar to a unicast address, the prefix of an IPv6 multicast address specifies its scope, however, the set of possible scopes for a multicast address is different. The 4-bit sc (or scope) field (bits 12 to 15) is used to indicate where the address is valid and unique.

The service is identified in the group ID field. For example, if  refers to all Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers on the local network segment, then  refers to all NTP servers in an organization's networks. The group ID field may be further divided for special multicast address types.

Notable IPv6 multicast addresses

The following table is a list notable IPv6 multicast addresses that are registered with IANA.

Ethernet

Ethernet frames with a value of 1 in the least-significant bit of the first octetOn Ethernet, the least-significant bit of an octet is the first to be transmitted. A multicast is indicated by the first transmitted bit of the destination address being 1. of the destination MAC address are treated as multicast frames and are flooded to all points on the network. While frames with ones in all bits of the destination address () are sometimes referred to as broadcasts, Ethernet generally does not distinguish between multicast and broadcast frames. Modern Ethernet controllers filter received packets to reduce CPU load, by looking up the hash of a multicast destination address in a table, initialized by software, which controls whether a multicast packet is dropped or fully received.

The IEEE has allocated the address block  to  for group addresses for use by standard protocols. Of these, the MAC group addresses in the range of  to  are not forwarded by 802.1D-conformant MAC bridges.

802.11

802.11 wireless networks use the same MAC addresses for multicast as Ethernet.

Currently, 3 of the 4 flag bits in the ''flags'' field (''ff1'') are defined;{{Ref RFC|4291}} the most-significant flag bit is reserved for future use. The other three flags are known as ''R'', ''P'' and ''T''.

Similar to a [[unicast]] address, the ''prefix'' of an IPv6 multicast address specifies its scope, however, the set of possible scopes for a multicast address is different. The 4-bit ''sc'' (or scope) field (bits 12 to 15) is used to indicate where the address is valid and unique.

The service is identified in the ''group ID'' field.

Ethernet frames with a value of 1 in the least-significant bit of the first octet<ref group=note>On Ethernet, the least-significant bit of an octet is the first to be transmitted. A multicast is indicated by the first transmitted bit of the destination address being 1.</ref> of the destination [[MAC address]] are treated as multicast frames and are flooded to all points on the network. While frames with ones in all bits of the destination address ({{macaddr|FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF}}) are sometimes referred to as [[Broadcasting (networking)|broadcasts]], Ethernet generally does not distinguish between multicast and broadcast frames. Modern Ethernet controllers filter received packets to reduce CPU load, by looking up the hash of a multicast destination address in a table, initialized by software, which controls whether a multicast packet is dropped or fully received.

The IEEE has allocated the address block {{macaddr|01-80-C2-00-00-00}} to {{macaddr|01-80-C2-FF-FF-FF}} for group addresses for use by standard protocols. Of these, the MAC group addresses in the range of {{macaddr|01-80-C2-00-00-00}} to {{macaddr|01-80-C2-00-00-0F}} are not forwarded by [[802.1D]]-conformant [[MAC bridge]]s.<ref>{{cite web |author=IEEE |url=http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/macgrp.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/macgrp.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |title=Standard Group MAC Address: A Tutorial Guide |publisher=IEEE Standards Association |pages=2â3}}</ref>
