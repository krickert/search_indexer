Personal mobility involves the network's capability to locate the terminal associated with the user for the purposes of addressing, routing, and charging the user for calls. "Access" is intended to convey the concepts of both originating and terminating services. Management of the service profile by the user is not part of personal mobility. The personal mobility aspects of personal communications are based on the UPT number.
