41428N-entity‡In telecommunication, a n-entity is an active element in the n-th layer of the Open Systems Interconnection--Reference Model (OSI-RM) that (a) interacts directly with elements, i.e., entities, of the layer immediately above or below the n-th layer, (b) is defined by a unique set of rules, i.e., syntax, and information formats, including data and control formats, and (c) performs a defined set of functions. 

The n refers to any one of the 7 layers of the OSI-RM. 

In an existing layered open system, the n may refer to any given layer in the system. 

Layers are conventionally numbered from the lowest, i.e., the physical layer, to the highest, so that the -th layer is above the n-th layer and the -th layer is below.

In [[telecommunication]], a '''''n''-entity''' is an active element in the ''n''-th layer of the [[Open Systems Interconnection--Reference Model]] (OSI-RM) that (a) interacts directly with elements, ''i.e.'', entities, of the layer immediately above or below the ''n''-th layer, (b) is defined by a unique set of rules, ''i.e.'', [[syntax]], and [[information]] formats, including [[data]] and control formats, and (c) performs a defined set of functions. 

The ''n'' refers to any one of the 7 layers of the OSI-RM. 

In an existing layered [[Open system (computing)|open system]], the ''n'' may refer to any given layer in the system. 

Layers are conventionally numbered from the lowest, ''i.e.'', the [[physical layer]], to the highest, so that the {{nowrap|(''n'' + 1)}}-th layer is above the ''n''-th layer and the {{nowrap|(''n'' ‚àí 1)}}-th layer is below.
