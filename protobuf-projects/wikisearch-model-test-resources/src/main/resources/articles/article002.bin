In [[telecommunication]]s, a '''hybrid balance''' is an expression of the degree of electrical symmetry between two [[impedance matching|impedances]] connected to two conjugate sides of a [[hybrid coil]] or [[resistance hybrid]]. It is usually expressed in [[decibel|dB]]. 

If the respective impedances of the branches of the hybrid that are connected to the conjugate sides of the hybrid are known, hybrid balance may be computed by the formula for [[return loss]].
