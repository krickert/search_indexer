41417Noise figureÁUNoise figure (NF) and noise factor (F) are figures of merit that indicate degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that is caused by components in a signal chain. These figures of merit are used to evaluate the performance of an amplifier or a radio receiver, with lower values indicating better performance.

The noise factor is defined as the ratio of the output noise power of a device to the portion thereof attributable to thermal noise in the input termination at standard noise temperature T0 (usually 290¬†K). The noise factor is thus the ratio of actual output noise to that which would remain if the device itself did not introduce noise, or the ratio of input SNR to output SNR.

The noise factor and noise figure are related, with the former being a unitless ratio and the latter being the same ratio but expressed in units of decibels (dB).

General 

The noise figure is the difference in decibels (dB) between the noise output of the actual receiver to the noise output of an ‚Äúideal‚Äù receiver with the same overall gain and bandwidth when the receivers are connected to matched sources at the standard noise temperature T0 (usually 290¬†K). The noise power from a simple load is equal to kTB, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature of the load (for example a resistor), and B is the measurement bandwidth.

This makes the noise figure a useful figure of merit for terrestrial systems, where the antenna effective temperature is usually near the standard 290¬†K.  In this case, one receiver with a noise figure, say 2¬†dB better than another, will have an output signal to noise ratio that is about 2¬†dB better than the other. However, in the case of satellite communications systems, where the receiver antenna is pointed out into cold space, the antenna effective temperature is often colder than 290¬†K. In these cases a 2¬†dB improvement in receiver noise figure will result in more than a 2¬†dB improvement in the output signal to noise ratio. For this reason, the related figure of effective noise temperature is therefore often used instead of the noise figure for characterizing satellite-communication receivers and low-noise amplifiers.

In heterodyne systems, output noise power includes spurious contributions from image-frequency transformation, but the portion attributable to thermal noise in the input termination at standard noise temperature includes only that which appears in the output via the principal frequency transformation of the system and excludes that which appears via the image frequency transformation.

Definition 

The noise factor  of a system is defined as.
{\mathrm{SNR}_\text{o}}
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}
where  and  are the input and output signal-to-noise ratios respectively. The  quantities are unitless power ratios. 
The noise figure  is defined as the noise factor in units of decibels (dB):

where  and  are in units of (dB).
These formulae are only valid when the input termination is at standard noise temperature , although in practice small differences in temperature do not significantly affect the values.

The noise factor of a device is related to its noise temperature : with some rearrangement from .
F = 1 + \frac{T_\text{e}}{T_0}.

Attenuators have a noise factor  equal to their attenuation ratio  when their physical temperature equals . More generally, for an attenuator at a physical temperature , the noise temperature is , giving a noise factor
F = 1 + \frac{(L - 1)T}{T_0}.

Noise factor of cascaded devices 

If several devices are cascaded, the total noise factor can be found with Friis' formula:.
F = F_1 + \frac{F_2 - 1}{G_1} + \frac{F_3 - 1}{G_1  G_2} + \frac{F_4 - 1}{G_1 G_2 G_3} + \cdots + \frac{F_n - 1}{G_1 G_2 G_3 \cdots G_{n-1}},
where  is the noise factor for the -th device, and  is the power gain (linear, not in dB) of the -th device. The first amplifier in a chain usually has the most significant effect on the total noise figure because the noise figures of the following stages are reduced by stage gains. Consequently, the first amplifier usually has a low noise figure, and the noise figure requirements of subsequent stages is usually more relaxed.

Noise factor as a function of additional noise

The noise factor may be expressed as a function of the additional output referred noise power N_a and the power gain G of an amplifier.

Derivation

From the definition of noise factor

F \frac{\mathrm{SNR}_\text{i}}{\mathrm{SNR}_\text{o}}
\frac{\frac{S_i}{N_i}}{\frac{S_o}{N_o}},

and assuming a system which has a noisy single stage amplifier. The signal to noise ratio of this amplifier would include its own output referred noise N_a, the amplified signal S_iG and the amplified input noise N_iG,

\frac{S_o}{N_o}=\frac{S_iG}{N_a+N_iG}

Substituting the output SNR to the noise factor definition,Aspen Core. [https://m.eet.com/media/1163845/4065-download_a_word_document.doc Derivation of noise figure equations (DOCX)], pp. 3‚Äì4

F \frac{\frac{S_i}{N_i}}{\frac{S_iG}{N_a+N_iG}}
\frac{N_a+N_iG}{N_iG} = 1 + \frac{N_a}{N_iG}

In cascaded systems N_i does not refer to the output noise of the previous component. An input termination at the standard noise temperature is still assumed for the individual component. This means that the additional noise power added by each component is independent of the other components.

Optical noise figure

The above describes noise in electrical systems. Electric sources generate noise with a power spectral density equal to , where  is the Boltzmann constant and  is the absolute temperature. However, there is also noise in optical systems. In these, the sources have no fundamental noise. Instead the energy quantization causes notable shot noise in the detector, corresponding to a noise power spectral density of  where  is the Planck constant and  is the optical frequency.

In the 1990ies, an optical noise figure has been defined.E. Desurvire, ‚ÄûErbium doped fiber amplifiers: Principles and Applications‚Äú, Wiley, New York, 1994 This has been called   for photon number fluctuations.H. A. Haus, "The noise figure of optical amplifiers," in IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, vol. 10, no. 11, pp. 1602-1604, Nov. 1998, doi: 10.1109/68.726763 The powers needed for SNR and noise factor calculation are the electrical powers caused by the current in a photodiode. SNR is the square of mean photocurrent divided by variance of photocurrent. Monochromatic or sufficiently attenuated light has a Poisson distribution of detected photons. If, during a detection interval the expectation value of detected photons is  then the variance is also  and one obtains   
 . Behind an optical amplifier with power gain  there will be a mean of  photons. In the limit of large  the variance of photons is  where  is the spontaneous emission factor. One obtains   
 . Resulting optical noise factor is   
 .

 is in conceptual conflict compared to the electrical noise factor, which is now called :

Photocurrent is proportional to optical power. Optical power is proportional to squares of a field amplitude (electric or magnetic). So, the receiver is nonlinear in amplitude. The power needed for  calculation is proportional to the 4th power of the signal amplitude. But for  in the electrical domain the power is proportional to the square of the signal amplitude. 

At a certain electrical frequency, noise occurs in phase (I) and in quadrature (Q) with the signal. Both these quadratures are available behind the electrical amplifier. The same holds in an optical amplifier. But the direct detection photoreceiver needed for measurement of  takes mainly the in-phase noise into account whereas quadrature noise can be neglected for high. Also, the receiver outputs only one quadrature. So, one quadrature is lost. 

For an optical amplifier with large  it holds  ‚â• 2 whereas for an electrical amplifier it holds  ‚â• 1.

Moreover, today's long-haul optical fiber communication is dominated by coherent optical I&Q receivers but  does not describe the SNR degradation observed in these.

The above conflicts are resolved by the optical in-phase and quadrature noise figure .R. Noe, "Consistent Optical and Electrical Noise Figure," in Journal of Lightwave Technology, 2022, doi: 10.1109/JLT.2022.3212936, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9915356 It can be measured using a coherent optical I&Q receiver. In these, power of the output signal is proportional to the square of an optical field amplitude because they are linear in amplitude. They pass both quadratures. For an optical amplifier it holds  
  ‚â• 1. Quantity  is the input-referred number of added noise photons per mode. 

 and  can easily be converted into each other. For large  it holds  =  or, when expressed in dB,  is 3 dB less than .

Unified noise figure

Total noise power spectral density per mode is  + . In the electrical domain  can be neglected. In the optical domain  can be neglected. In between, say, in the low THz or thermal domain, both will need to be considered. It is possible to blend between electrical and optical domains such that a universal noise figure is obtained. 

This has been attempted by unifying  and .H. A. Haus, "Noise Figure Definition Valid From RF to Optical Frequencies," in IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS, VOL. 6, NO. 2, MARCH/APRIL 2000, pp. 240-247 But the conceptual difference between  and  cannot be overcome: It seems impossible that for increasing frequency (from electrical to thermal to optical) squares of signal amplitudes (powers in the electrical domain) gradually become 4th powers of amplitudes (powers in optical direct detection receivers) and 2 quadratures (in the electrical domain) gradually become 1 quadrature (in optical direct detection receivers). Also, the ideal noise factor would need to go from 1 (electrical) to 2 (optical), which is not intuitive.

A consistent unification of optical and electrical noise figures is obtained for  and . There are no contradictions because both these are in conceptual match (powers proportional to squares of amplitudes, 2 quadratures, ideal noise factor equal to 1). Thermal noise  and fundamental quantum noise  are taken into account. The unified noise figure is

However, in the case of satellite communications systems, where the receiver antenna is pointed out into cold space, the antenna effective temperature is often colder than 290¬†K. In these cases a 2¬†dB improvement in receiver noise figure will result in more than a 2¬†dB improvement in the output signal to noise ratio. For this reason, the related figure of effective noise temperature is therefore often used instead of the noise figure for characterizing satellite-communication receivers and low-noise amplifiers.JÉIn heterodyne systems, output noise power includes spurious contributions from image-frequency transformation, but the portion attributable to thermal noise in the input termination at standard noise temperature includes only that which appears in the output via the principal frequency transformation of the system and excludes that which appears via the image frequency transformation.J

More generally, for an attenuator at a physical temperature , the noise temperature is , giving a noise factorJF = 1 + \frac{(L - 1)T}{T_0}.J Noise factor of cascaded devicesJZIf several devices are cascaded, the total noise factor can be found with Friis' formula:.JåF = F_1 + \frac{F_2 - 1}{G_1} + \frac{F_3 - 1}{G_1 G_2} + \frac{F_4 - 1}{G_1 G_2 G_3} + \cdots + \frac{F_n - 1}{G_1 G_2 G_3 \cdots G_{n-1}},J´where is the noise factor for the -th device, and is the power gain (linear, not in dB) of the -th device. The first amplifier in a chain usually has the most significant effect on the total noise figure because the noise figures of the following stages are reduced by stage gains. Consequently, the first amplifier usually has a low noise figure, and the noise figure requirements of subsequent stages is usually more relaxed.J.Noise factor as a function of additional noiseJáThe noise factor may be expressed as a function of the additional output referred noise power N_a and the power gain G of an amplifier.J

The signal to noise ratio of this amplifier would include its own output referred noise N_a, the amplified signal S_iG and the amplified input noise N_iG,J%\frac{S_o}{N_o}=\frac{S_iG}{N_a+N_iG}JRSubstituting the output SNR to the noise factor definition,Aspen Core. , pp. 3‚Äì4J/F \frac{\frac{S_i}{N_i}}{\frac{S_iG}{N_a+N_iG}}J,\frac{N_a+N_iG}{N_iG} = 1 + \frac{N_a}{N_iG}J¶In cascaded systems N_i does not refer to the output noise of the previous component. An input termination at the standard noise temperature is still assumed for the individual component. This means that the additional noise power added by each component is independent of the other components.JOptical noise figureJ’The above describes noise in electrical systems. Electric sources generate noise with a power spectral density equal to , where is the Boltzmann constant and is the absolute temperature. However, there is also noise in optical systems. In these, the sources have no fundamental noise. Instead the energy quantization causes notable shot noise in the detector, corresponding to a noise power spectral density of where is the Planck constant and is the optical frequency.JäIn the 1990ies, an optical noise figure has been defined.E. Desurvire, ‚ÄûErbium doped fiber amplifiers: Principles and Applications‚Äú, Wiley, New York, 1994 This has been called for photon number fluctuations.H. A. Haus, "The noise figure of optical amplifiers," in IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, vol. 10, no. 11, pp. 1602-1604, Nov. 1998, doi: 10.1109/68.726763 The powers needed for SNR and noise factor calculation are the electrical powers caused by the current in a photodiode. SNR is the square of mean photocurrent divided by variance of photocurrent. Monochromatic or sufficiently attenuated light has a Poisson distribution of detected photons. If, during a detection interval the expectation value of detected photons is then the variance is also and one obtainsJµ. Behind an optical amplifier with power gain there will be a mean of photons. In the limit of large the variance of photons is where is the spontaneous emission factor. One obtainsJ#. Resulting optical noise factor isJXis in conceptual conflict compared to the electrical noise factor, which is now called :JÌPhotocurrent is proportional to optical power. Optical power is proportional to squares of a field amplitude (electric or magnetic). So, the receiver is nonlinear in amplitude. The power needed for calculation is proportional to the 4th power of the signal amplitude. But for in the electrical domain the power is proportional to the square of the signal amplitude.JøAt a certain electrical frequency, noise occurs in phase (I) and in quadrature (Q) with the signal. Both these quadratures are available behind the electrical amplifier. The same holds in an optical amplifier. But the direct detection photoreceiver needed for measurement of takes mainly the in-phase noise into account whereas quadrature noise can be neglected for high. Also, the receiver outputs only one quadrature. So, one quadrature is lost.JfFor an optical amplifier with large it holds ‚â• 2 whereas for an electrical amplifier it holds ‚â• 1.J£Moreover, today's long-haul optical fiber communication is dominated by coherent optical I&Q receivers but does not describe the SNR degradation observed in these.JÑThe above conflicts are resolved by the optical in-phase and quadrature noise figure .R. Noe, "Consistent Optical and Electrical Noise Figure," in Journal of Lightwave Technology, 2022, doi: 10.1109/JLT.2022.3212936, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9915356 It can be measured using a coherent optical I&Q receiver. In these, power of the output signal is proportional to the square of an optical field amplitude because they are linear in amplitude. They pass both quadratures. For an optical amplifier it holdsJM‚â• 1. Quantity is the input-referred number of added noise photons per mode.Joand can easily be converted into each other. For large it holds = or, when expressed in dB, is 3 dB less than .JUnified noise figureJ»Total noise power spectral density per mode is + . In the electrical domain can be neglected. In the optical domain can be neglected. In between, say, in the low THz or thermal domain, both will need to be considered. It is possible to blend between electrical and optical domains such that a universal noise figure is obtained.JÍThis has been attempted by unifying and .H. A. Haus, "Noise Figure Definition Valid From RF to Optical Frequencies," in IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS, VOL. 6, NO. 2, MARCH/APRIL 2000, pp. 240-247 But the conceptual difference between and cannot be overcome: It seems impossible that for increasing frequency (from electrical to thermal to optical) squares of signal amplitudes (powers in the electrical domain) gradually become 4th powers of amplitudes (powers in optical direct detection receivers) and 2 quadratures (in the electrical domain) gradually become 1 quadrature (in optical direct detection receivers). Also, the ideal noise factor would need to go from 1 (electrical) to 2 (optical), which is not intuitive.J€A consistent unification of optical and electrical noise figures is obtained for and . There are no contradictions because both these are in conceptual match (powers proportional to squares of amplitudes, 2 quadratures, ideal noise factor equal to 1). Thermal noise and fundamental quantum noise are taken into account. The unified noise figure isJSee alsoJr* Noise
