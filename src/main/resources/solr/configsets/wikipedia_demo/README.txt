This is the sample config set that is used for the wikipedia demo.  This readme explains what config settings changed to make this configuration:

1) Added fields for title, body, id, url to the schema
2) Turned on NLP 
3) added the basic datasets for English language for opennlp to do the entity extraction
4) turned on infostream (useful for lucene debugging - and it doesn't take up much room so it's good to keep on)
